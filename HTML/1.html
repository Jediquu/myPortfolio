            <p>Hi! I am the center of the universe, lifegiving undefined substance which defines all but itself. I “come” before all knowledge and before any perception of the worlds. Yet I am unseen, for I, that is you, can see primary outward, for there
                is nothing to be seen inwardly. </p>
            <p>You probably wonder --- who I am, don’t you? I am being materialized when man acts wisely and unbased – that is no human inclinations, appetites, even ideas which substitute one’s well-being essentially matter. For example, when our conscience
                does not get along with your actions and you, subsequently, change you way, that is me, the world Geist that shows you that doing bad to others is fundamentally evil.</p>
            <p>The primary difference between Geist and soul is that the former is not bound to worldly actions and goals, it flies when soul instead would worry about mundane and professional competitive goals. Soul concerns its well-being only. Here man’s
                is ruled by a practically determined mind set which is what soul is about. Geist is the Manifestation of freedom.</p>

            Until now I was talking about materialization as postulation of my existence; however, there is the outer side of the coin – inward realization of inherent connection with other people, with nature, with rustling leaves…

        <p>
            Great deal of the inner search represents the New Testament, read metaphorically. Jesus has realized the God as his conscience and wisdom that dictates, suggests what is to be done, what is good and evil. His way, the way in out material world with materialized
            soul started with god’s blessing of freedom –the great mercy beamed upon us –and ended up in an utmost isolation of soul and fletch from any meaning that goes beyond…

            I am being realized neither in schisms of churches, nor in political and philosophical discussion, but in that experience to unite. I see a great improvement in people’s ultimacy of different views. In Zen-Buddhism, Christianity… people come to common
            knowledge of me that forms space, that represents the God.
